# Hi! I'm Ivan

Software developer with primary interest in Rust backend development.
Other than that, I have experience in C++, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript. During my professional career that started in 2015,
I have learned to develop based on clean code, SOLID design principles, design patterns and test driven development.
